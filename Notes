Notes

OK so routes.rb has some stuff in it but not much.  When you run rake routes, it spits out some stuff, "routes for the standard RESTful actions" says the getting started guide.  Where do these come from? They aren't in routes.rb.  I do recognize that GET/POST etc stuff, but somehow it maps to operations in the posts class(?) called "index", "create", "new" etc and I don't know where those come from.  Dennis can explain???  Kynnin can help me grok? Or just looking at this with a better-rested beer-free mind?

Getting Started guide section 5.8 says it's a specific route from routes.rb.
